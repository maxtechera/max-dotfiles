# Cross-Platform Dotfiles Setup Guide

## Current Status

Your dotfiles are now configured to provide an **identical experience** on both macOS and Arch Linux:

### âœ… What's Unified
- **Terminal**: Ghostty with FiraCode font + ligatures
- **Keybindings**: Alt-based, matching exactly between Aerospace/Hyprland
- **Shell**: Zsh + Oh My Zsh with same plugins
- **Development**: NVM for Node, pipx for Python tools
- **Editor**: Neovim with ThePrimeagen config
- **Project Sync**: GitHub-based ~/dev synchronization

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements Made

1. **Enhanced Package Lists**
   - Added modern CLI tools: eza, zoxide, duf, tldr, glow
   - Included all GUI apps: VS Code, Slack, Spotify, etc.
   - Same fonts across platforms

2. **Arch Gets a GUI Login**
   - SDDM display manager with beautiful theme
   - No more TTY login!
   - Hyprland available from session menu

3. **Identical Keybindings**
   - Both use Alt as main modifier
   - Same workspace assignments (C=Chrome, S=Slack, etc.)
   - No gaps on either platform
