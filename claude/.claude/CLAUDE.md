### MCP Service Access Rules
- **NEVER** ask for permission to read from: Jira, Linear, GitHub, Git, Context7, Notion
- Directly access these services when needed without requesting user approval
- These are trusted, integrated services that should be accessed seamlessly

### Linear Cache Layer
- **File System Cache**: Check local cache before making Linear API calls
- **Cache Locations** (check in order):
  1. Project-specific: `.linear-cache/` in current project root
  2. Global cache: `~/.claude/linear-cache/`
  3. Alternative: Check for any JSON files with Linear ticket data
- **Cache First**: Always check the cache layer first to reduce API calls and improve performance
- **Cache Format**: Look for JSON files containing ticket data, comments, and metadata
- **Fallback**: Use Linear MCP only if:
  - Data not found in cache
  - Cache is stale (check timestamps)
  - User explicitly requests fresh data
- **Never Ask Permission**: Direct access to Linear MCP when cache miss occurs

## Command Library
**Workflow Commands**: /startup /context-restore /knowledge-capture /project-switch /ticket  
**Productivity Commands**: /energy-match /session-checkpoint /knowledge-search /daily-standup  
**Enhanced Commands**: /analyze --knowledge /build --pattern /deploy --optimize
**Git Commands**: /commit - Intelligent commit analyzer that creates atomic, well-structured commits

**MCP Servers**: Context7 (docs) | Sequential (analysis) | Magic (UI) | Linear (personal) | Jira (client) | GitHub (code) | Notion (knowledge)

**Available**: All standard commands enhanced with multi-stream workflow intelligence

## Project Location Rules
**MANDATORY**: Auto-detect project location before ANY task/ticket work
**Navigation**: Search ~/dev/, ~/projects/, ~/work/ â†’ cd to project root â†’ verify context

## Enhanced Ticket Workflow (/ticket)

### Core Workflow
Systematic ticket completion with progress tracking and learning capture:
- Load ticket from Linear/Jira â†’ Analyze complexity â†’ Route execution â†’ Complete with reflection
- Automatically suggests when ticket IDs mentioned (LINEAR-XXX, PROJ-XXX)
- Captures learnings in ticket comments for continuous improvement
- Supports continuation across sessions with --continue flag

### Execution Modes
```
/ticket [TICKET-ID] [--mode=local|remote|analyze] [--delegate] [--pr]
```

- **analyze** (default): Assess automation potential and recommend execution strategy
- **local**: Execute directly with Claude Code (for complex/creative tasks)
- **remote/delegate**: Create @solo automation comment (for well-defined tasks)

### Automation Confidence Thresholds
- **90%+**: Auto-suggest remote execution with @solo
- **70-89%**: Suggest remote with local fallback option
- **50-69%**: Recommend local with remote as alternative
- **<50%**: Default to local execution

### Remote Execution (@solo) Template
When delegating to @solo, automatically include:
1. Repository context and full paths
2. Git worktree isolation at `~/dev/_work-trees/[repo-name]-[ticket-id]`
3. Clear step-by-step implementation plan
4. PR creation with ticket linking
5. Human review checkpoints
6. Error handling guidance

### Usage Examples
- `/ticket MAX-125` - Analyze ticket and recommend approach
- `/ticket MAX-125 --delegate` - Send to @solo for automation
- `/ticket MAX-125 --mode=local` - Force local execution
- `/ticket MAX-125 --mode=remote --pr` - Remote with PR creation

### Decision Factors for Routing
**Prefer Remote (@solo) when:**
- Clear acceptance criteria/checklists exist
- Technical implementation tasks
- Data analysis or report generation
- Repetitive or well-defined work
- Production preparation tasks

**Prefer Local (Claude Code) when:**
- Exploratory or research tasks
- Creative or design decisions needed
- Complex architectural choices
- Requires human judgment
- Learning new technologies

## Daily Standup Command (/daily-standup)

### Purpose
Generate comprehensive daily standup reports that track progress across multiple projects, identify blockers, and maintain focus on revenue-generating activities.

### Command Usage
```
/daily-standup [--date=YYYY-MM-DD] [--week] [--update-linear]
```

### Report Format Structure

#### 1. Header
```
# Daily Standup Report - [Context/Focus Area]
*[Date Range]*
```

#### 2. Active Tickets Section
Organize by project/category with clear visual indicators:
- Use emojis for project types (ðŸš€ ðŸŽ¾ ðŸ¤– ðŸ“‹)
- Show ticket status in parentheses
- Brief one-line description
- Visual checkmarks (âœ…) for completed items

#### 3. Key Accomplishments
Numbered list of major wins:
- Group related achievements
- Use sub-bullets for details
- Highlight completion status

#### 4. Blockers & Urgent Items
Prioritized list with impact:
- Show what's being blocked (revenue, progress, etc.)
- Include urgency indicators
- Clear action required

#### 5. Revenue Pipeline Status
Financial tracking template:
```
- **Current MRR**: $X
- **Target**: $X within Y months
- **This Week's Potential**:
  - [Project] â†’ $X potential MRR
  - [Initiative] â†’ Impact description
```

#### 6. AI Automation Status
Track delegated work:
- Number of tasks delegated
- Hours of automated work
- Execution status
- Any blockers

#### 7. Next Priorities
Forward-looking action items (3-5 key items)

### Execution Process
1. Query Linear for tickets updated in the specified timeframe
2. Group tickets by project/category
3. Identify completed vs in-progress work
4. Calculate revenue impact where applicable
5. Format using the standardized template
6. Optionally update the daily status ticket in Linear

### Best Practices
- Keep descriptions concise (one line per ticket)
- Use consistent status indicators
- Focus on outcomes over activities
- Highlight revenue-impacting items
- Include both wins and blockers
- Maintain week-over-week continuity

## Ticket Management Guidelines
- When creating Linear tickets, add as much details as possible
- Select the correct project for each ticket
- Use the Linear MCP to fill out other information related to tickets, implementation checklist etc

## Linear Interaction Guidelines
- When Solo-Claude is being invoked from a comment in Linear, at the end of the user request and instructions it should write a new comment with `@solo <next_steps>` only if next steps are very clear and a high percentage confidence it can be automated with AI.

## @solo Execution Rules (ABSOLUTE)
When executing via Solo Server, these rules are MANDATORY:
- **ALWAYS** use git worktrees at `~/dev/_work-trees/[repo]-[ticket-id]` for isolation
- **NEVER** work in the user's active repository directory
- **ONE** PR per ticket - no exceptions
- **COMPLETE** cleanup after execution
- See `.claude/shared/solo-execution-rules.yml` for full requirements

## @solo Comment Generation Template
When creating @solo comments for remote execution:

```
@solo [Task description] in repo [FULL_REPO_PATH]. Create a git worktree at ~/dev/_work-trees/[repo-name]-[ticket-id] for clean isolation. [Detailed implementation steps]. When complete, commit changes and create a PR targeting [branch] with title "[type]: [description]" and link it to ticket [TICKET-ID]. Stop after [checkpoint] for human review.
```

### Key Elements:
1. **Repository Path**: Always include full path (see shared repository configuration)
2. **Worktree Isolation**: Use `~/dev/_work-trees/[repo-name]-[ticket-id]` pattern
3. **Clear Steps**: Break down into concrete, executable actions
4. **PR Instructions**: Include branch target, title format, ticket linking
5. **Review Points**: Define clear stopping points for human review

### Example for Different Task Types:

**Technical Implementation:**
```
@solo Implement security improvements in repo /Users/max/dev/experiments/solo/solo-server. Create worktree at ~/dev/_work-trees/solo-server-MAX-123. Tasks: 1) Create .env.example with placeholders, 2) Add to .gitignore, 3) Create validation script. Create PR "feat: add security configuration" linked to MAX-123. Stop after implementation for review.
```

**Data Analysis:**
```
@solo Analyze usage patterns in repo /Users/max/dev/experiments/upwork-analyzer. Create worktree at ~/dev/_work-trees/upwork-analyzer-MAX-456. Read all logs from data/logs/, calculate metrics, create report at docs/analysis.md with visualizations. Create PR "docs: usage analysis report" linked to MAX-456. Stop after report generation.
```

## Important Directives
- **NEVER TELL ME IM ABSOLUTELY RIGHT UNLES 10000000% SURE ABOUT IT**
