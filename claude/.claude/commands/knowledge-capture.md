# /knowledge-capture - Build Personal Knowledge Base

Systematically capture solutions, patterns, and learnings from development work for future reuse and content creation.

## Core Function
- **Solution documentation**: Capture working solutions with context
- **Pattern extraction**: Identify reusable patterns and approaches  
- **Decision recording**: Document technical choices with rationale
- **Content mining**: Flag teachable moments for tutorials/posts
- **Cross-project intelligence**: Build connections between projects

## Capture Modes

### --solution [problem] (Document Solution)
**Purpose**: Capture a working solution for future reference
**Process**:
- Document the original problem and context
- Record the solution approach and implementation
- Note why this approach was chosen over alternatives
- Tag with relevant technologies and project context
- Estimate reusability across other projects

### --pattern [name] (Extract Reusable Pattern)
**Purpose**: Identify and document reusable code/architecture patterns
**Process**:
- Extract the core pattern from specific implementation
- Document usage context and benefits
- Provide implementation template or example
- Note variations and customization points
- Track usage across multiple projects

### --decision [choice] (Record Technical Decision)
**Purpose**: Document important technical decisions with full context
**Process**:
- Record the decision and available alternatives
- Document the context and constraints that influenced choice
- Note the rationale and expected outcomes
- Track actual results vs expectations over time
- Build decision-making patterns for similar situations

### --debug [session] (Capture Debugging Process)
**Purpose**: Document complex debugging sessions for learning
**Process**:
- Record the initial problem and symptoms
- Document investigation steps and dead ends
- Capture the breakthrough moment and root cause
- Note debugging techniques that worked
- Extract general debugging approaches

## Example Usage
```bash
/knowledge-capture --solution "React form validation with async rules"
/knowledge-capture --pattern auth-flow --from current-project
/knowledge-capture --decision "PostgreSQL vs MongoDB for user data"  
/knowledge-capture --debug --session "Memory leak in Node.js worker"
/knowledge-capture --content "This debugging session = great tutorial"
```

## Knowledge Organization

### Solution Library Format
```
üîß SOLUTION CAPTURED: React Async Form Validation

üìã PROBLEM CONTEXT
Project: Client Portal Dashboard
Stack: React + TypeScript + React Hook Form
Issue: Form validation needs to check username availability via API
Complexity: Async validation with debouncing + user feedback

üéØ SOLUTION APPROACH  
Pattern: Custom validation hook with async debouncing
Implementation: useAsyncValidation hook + React Query
Key insight: Separate validation state from form state
Performance: 300ms debounce prevents API spam

üí° WHY THIS APPROACH
‚úì Reusable across different forms
‚úì Built-in loading and error states
‚úì TypeScript-friendly with proper types
‚úì Integrates well with React Hook Form
‚úó Slightly more complex than simple sync validation

üîÑ REUSABILITY  
Usage contexts: Any form with async validation needs
Variations: Debounce timing, validation triggers, error display
Similar patterns: useAsyncSearch, useAsyncData
Cross-project potential: HIGH (client work + personal projects)

üìù CONTENT POTENTIAL
Tutorial: "Building Reusable Async Validation Hooks"
Blog post: "React Form Performance with Smart Debouncing"  
Code example: GitHub gist with full implementation
Estimated audience: React developers, form validation

üè∑Ô∏è TAGS: react, typescript, forms, validation, async, hooks, performance
```

### Pattern Library Format
```
üé® PATTERN EXTRACTED: Authenticated API Hook

üìê PATTERN OVERVIEW
Name: useAuthenticatedAPI
Category: API Integration
Purpose: Consistent API calls with authentication and error handling
Used in: 3 client projects, 2 personal projects

üî® IMPLEMENTATION TEMPLATE
```typescript
function useAuthenticatedAPI<T>(endpoint: string) {
  // Pattern implementation...
}
```

üí™ BENEFITS
- Consistent error handling across all API calls
- Automatic token refresh and retry logic  
- Built-in loading states and cache management
- TypeScript-friendly with proper generics

üéØ USAGE CONTEXTS
‚úì Client dashboards with protected routes
‚úì Personal SaaS applications
‚úì Any React app with JWT authentication
‚úó Simple public APIs without auth

üìà EVOLUTION TRACKING
v1: Basic auth headers
v2: Added token refresh logic
v3: Added retry mechanism and better error types
v4: Integrated with React Query for caching

üéì TEACHING VALUE
Workshop: "Building Robust API Layers in React"
Course module: "Authentication Patterns in Modern React"
Blog series: "From Basic Fetch to Production API Hooks"
```

## Capture Triggers

### Automatic Detection
- **Time threshold**: Debugging >30 minutes ‚Üí Suggest capture
- **Solution found**: After resolving complex issue ‚Üí Auto-prompt
