# Notion Workflows for Solopreneurs
# Knowledge management, pattern extraction, and content planning

## Core Notion Databases

Pattern_Library:
  purpose: "Reusable solutions from all projects"
  properties:
    - name: Pattern name
    - problem: What it solves
    - solution: Implementation approach
    - code: Snippet or template
    - projects: Where it's been used
    - time_saved: Hours saved by reuse
    - tags: Technologies, concepts
  workflow:
    - Detect pattern usage 3+ times
    - Extract to Notion with full context
    - Link to source projects
    - Calculate time/money saved

Decision_Log:
  purpose: "Technical and business decisions with full context"
  properties:
    - decision: What was decided
    - context: Why this mattered
    - alternatives: What else was considered
    - rationale: Why this choice won
    - outcome: Actual results vs expected
    - project: Where this applies
    - date: When decided
  workflow:
    - Major architecture decisions → Notion
    - Technology choices → Document rationale
    - Business pivots → Track reasoning
    - Review quarterly for patterns

Learning_Database:
  purpose: "Continuous learning from all work streams"
  properties:
    - lesson: What was learned
    - source: Client work, personal project, content
    - category: Debugging, architecture, process, tool
    - impact: How it changed approach
    - applications: Where else this applies
    - content_potential: Tutorial/blog idea rating
  workflow:
    - End of debugging session → Capture insight
    - Project milestone → Document learnings
    - Weekly review → Extract patterns

Content_Calendar:
  purpose: "Transform development work into teaching content"
  properties:
    - topic: Content idea
    - source: Origin (debugging session, pattern, decision)
    - format: Blog, video, thread, course module
    - audience: Target developer level
    - status: Idea, outlined, drafted, published
    - estimated_reach: View/engagement potential
    - related_patterns: Links to pattern library
  workflow:
    - Development insight → Content idea
    - Link to source material
    - Batch similar topics
    - Track performance post-publish

## Integration Workflows

Weekly_Pattern_Extraction:
  description: "Systematic knowledge capture from week's work"
  process:
    1: Review Linear (personal) and Jira (client) completed items
    2: Identify reusable patterns and solutions
    3: Extract to Notion pattern library with code examples
    4: Link patterns to source projects
    5: Note content opportunities
    6: Update time-saved metrics

Development_to_Documentation:
  description: "Real-time knowledge capture during development"
  triggers:
    - Complex problem solved → Document approach
    - New pattern emerges → Add to library
    - Decision point → Log with context
    - Debugging breakthrough → Learning capture
  output:
    - Searchable knowledge base
    - Reusable pattern library
    - Content idea pipeline
    - Decision history

Cross_Project_Intelligence:
  description: "Apply learnings across all work streams"
  workflow:
    - Client solution → Check pattern library
    - Personal project → Apply client learnings
    - Content creation → Use real examples
    - Pattern detection → Update Notion
  benefits:
    - Faster problem solving
    - Consistent quality
    - Knowledge compound effect
    - Authority building

Content_Pipeline_Management:
  description: "Transform daily work into valuable content"
  stages:
    1_capture: Auto-flag teachable moments during development
    2_organize: Group related insights in Notion
    3_outline: Create content structure from patterns
    4_produce: Reference Notion during content creation
    5_track: Monitor performance and iterate

## Notion MCP Usage Patterns

Quick_Capture:
  command: "notion create page"
  usage: "Immediate insight capture during development"
  example: "Just solved OAuth error → Notion learning"

Pattern_Search:
  command: "notion search [pattern]"
  usage: "Find previously solved similar problems"
  example: "Need auth flow → Search Notion patterns"

Decision_Reference:
  command: "notion get page [decision]"
  usage: "Recall why certain choices were made"
  example: "Why PostgreSQL? → Check decision log"

Content_Planning:
  command: "notion update database"
  usage: "Add content ideas from current work"
  example: "Great debugging session → Content calendar"
