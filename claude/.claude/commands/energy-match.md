# /energy-match - Optimal Task for Current Energy

Matches current energy level to the most appropriate tasks for maximum productivity and output quality.

## Core Function
- Assess current energy level & cognitive capacity
- Recommend optimal tasks for current state
- Protect high-energy slots for high-value work
- Optimize task sequencing for sustained performance
- Prevent energy waste on mismatched activities

## Usage
```bash
/energy-match              # Auto-detect current energy & recommend
/energy-match --peak       # Force peak energy task recommendations
/energy-match --low        # Force low energy task recommendations
/energy-match --schedule   # Show optimal daily energy schedule
```

## Energy Level Detection
- **Current time** vs personal energy patterns
- **Recent activity** intensity & duration
- **Cognitive load** from previous tasks
- **Physical indicators** (if available)
- **Weekly/monthly** energy trends
