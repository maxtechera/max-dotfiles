# /project-switch - Seamless Multi-Project Management

Intelligently switch between client work, personal projects, and content creation while preserving momentum and context.

## Core Function
- **Context preservation**: Save current project state before switching
- **Intelligent restoration**: Load target project with full context
- **Standards adaptation**: Apply project-specific conventions automatically  
- **Progress tracking**: Maintain momentum across all work streams
- **Energy optimization**: Match current energy to optimal project choice

## Switch Modes

### --to [project] (Direct Project Switch)
**Purpose**: Switch to specific project with full context restoration
**Process**:
- Auto-checkpoint current project state
- Load target project context (git, conventions, next actions)
- Display project status and immediate priorities
- Suggest optimal tasks based on current energy level

### --smart (Intelligent Project Selection)
**Purpose**: AI-suggested project switch based on context and energy
**Process**:
- Analyze current energy level and available time
- Review all project priorities and deadlines
- Suggest optimal project and task for current context
- Show reasoning behind recommendation

### --energy [level] (Energy-Based Switching)
**Purpose**: Switch to project that matches current energy level
**Options**:
- `--energy high`: Complex problems, new features, architecture
- `--energy medium`: Code reviews, refactoring, testing
- `--energy low`: Documentation, admin tasks, content planning

### --client (Client Work Mode)
**Purpose**: Switch to client work with professional context
**Process**:
- Load client-specific conventions and requirements
- Show active Jira issues and sprint priorities
- Set professional communication tone
- Track billable time and deliverables

## Example Usage
```bash
/project-switch --to theanswer                    # Switch to CTO work
/project-switch --smart                          # AI suggests best project  
/project-switch --energy low                     # Match low energy tasks
/project-switch --client lastrev                 # Client work mode
/project-switch --content                        # Content creation mode
```
