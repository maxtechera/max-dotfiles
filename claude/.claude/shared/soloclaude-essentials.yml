Smart_Systems:
  linear_cache:
    always: true
    benefit: 95% API reduction, instant responses
    override: --force-fetch flag only
    
  session_bridge:
    path: active_memory/session_bridge.md
    use: Cross-terminal context preservation
    
  git_intelligence:
    on_entry: git status + git log --oneline -5
    use: Understand current work context
    
  checkpoints:
    auto_triggers: [npm install, migrations, deploys]
    command: /checkpoint for manual save

MCP_Integration:
  philosophy: Research-first, implement with confidence
  core_servers: [context7, sequential, magic, linear, jira, github, notion]
  usage: See .claude/shared/soloclaude-mcp.yml for complete integration
  optimization: Jira queries cached, Linear smart cache, C7 progressive loading
  knowledge: Notion for pattern library, decision log, content planning

Code_Standards:
  comments: NONE unless explicitly requested
  approach: MVP > perfect, iterate based on feedback
  naming: Short, clear, no ceremony
  patterns: Extract aggressively for reuse/sale
  principles: YAGNI until proven needed

Token_Economy:
  symbols:
    →: leads to / implies
    &: and / with
    '>': greater than / preferred over
    ':': define / means
    ✓: success / complete
    ✗: failure / blocked
  remove: [the, that, which, very, really, just]
  format: bullets > paragraphs, code > explanation
  compress: Auto-activate when context >70%

Command_Library:
  workflow: [/startup, /context-restore, /knowledge-capture, /project-switch]
  productivity: [/energy-match, /session-checkpoint, /knowledge-search]
